## Description
Stock Trading Web Application built using the MERN Stack. Currently, it's still in WIP but way past a proof on concept! This is a personal project but uses the same idea of a stock trading web application from a course I did in school. However, all code here was typed from scratch for educational purposes and for fun! Furthermore, this project uses ReactJS and Redux whereas the other project used HBS, a templating engine.
